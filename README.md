# Student-Management-System

## Singly Linked List: Student Management System 
This is a Student Management System implemented using a Singly Linked List in C++. The system allows users to manage a list of students, track their marks, and apply grace marks to students who have obtained fewer than 30 marks.

## Features
- **Add Students**: Add new students by providing their name and marks.
- **Display Students**: Display a list of all students with their names, marks, and grace status.
- **Apply Grace Marks**: Automatically apply 5 grace marks to students with marks below 30, if grace marks haven't been given yet.
- **Singly Linked List**: The students' data is managed using a Singly linked list, which ensures that the list is efficiently traversed.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Choose options from a menu to interact with the system, including adding students, displaying student data, and applying grace marks.
